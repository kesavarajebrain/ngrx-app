NGRX - Reactive State for Angular

install cmd - ng add @ngrx/store@latest - it will install latest ngrx

Basic counter example, so create the basic structure

New folder - shared/store - inside we have actions, reducers, state files
 ng g s shared/master
 CREATE src/app/shared/master.service.spec.ts (373 bytes)
 CREATE src/app/shared/master.service.ts (144 bytes)

 inside the shared folder create our store

 inside create 3 files, 
 counter.action.ts, counter.reducer.ts, counter.state.ts, counter.modal.ts, counter.selector.ts

 actions - define our actions
 reducer - do our logic what performed inside the store
 state - default state define here
 modal - what are the content in the state we define here
 selector - avoid the performance issue, if the store configured multiple place so once state changes means reflected all places

 include our store to app.module

 npm install ngx-bootstrap bootstrap --save

 ng add @angular/material

 adding observable for easy access state values

 add selector 

 debugging tools
 1. install redux devtools extension
 2. ng add @ngrx/store-devtools@latest

 create another store for the feed 

 create another folder inside our store called global

 global - maintain global states

 ng add @ngrx/effects@latest
